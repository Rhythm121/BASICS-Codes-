Q)a fun fair, a street vendor is selling different colours of balloons. He sells N number of different colours of balloons (8[]). e task is to find the colour (odd) of the balloon which is present odd number of times in the bunch of balloons.

te: If there is more than one colour which is odd in number, then the first colour in the array which is present odd number of times is splayed. The colours of the balloons can all be either upper case or lower case in the array. If all the inputs are even in number, splay the message "All are even".

put Format for testing :-

A

- The candidate has to write the code to accept: 2 input

First input: Accept value for number of N(Positive integer number). Second Input: Accept N number of character values (B[]), where each value is separated by a new line.

utput format for testing:

The output should be a single literal

Example 1:

Input:

7

r,g,b,b,B,Y,

Output:
r

code-
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

#define ASCII 256

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;

    // You need to resize the string before reading characters into it
    s.resize(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> s[i];
    }

    int arr[ASCII] = {0};
int m=0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        arr[s[i]]++;
       if(m<arr[s[i]]){
           m=arr[s[i]];
           if(m%2!=0){
               cout<<s[i];
           }
       }
       
        }
    return 0;
}
